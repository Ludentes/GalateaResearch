## Why Archived?

These files represent the initial vision created in 2024. They have been:
- Reorganized for clarity
- Renamed for better discoverability
- Updated with 2025-2026 technology context
- Integrated into a cohesive documentation structure

The originals are preserved here for reference and historical context.

## Using These Files

**Don't use these directly.** Instead, use the organized versions in `/docs`:
- `/docs/architecture/` - System architecture documents
- `/docs/systems/` - Component specifications
- `/docs/guides/` - Implementation guides
- `/docs/research/` - Background research

See `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` in the project root for the complete current structure.
