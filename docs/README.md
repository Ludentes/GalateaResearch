- **memory-systems.md** - Multi-layered memory architecture (Working, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Emotional)
- **cognitive-models.md** - Model architecture (Self, User, Domain, Conversation, Relationship)
- **processing-pipeline.md** - Request processing stages and metaprocessing logic

### `/systems` - Component Specifications
- **subsystems-overview.md** - Complete list of 62 psychological subsystems
- **processing-examples.md** - Detailed pipeline examples (crisis, learning, dependency)

### `/guides` - Implementation Guides
- **safety-considerations.md** - Critical safety mechanisms and real-world case studies
- **curriculum-modules-7-11.md** - Teaching materials for advanced psychology modules

### `/research` - Background Research

## Project Status

**Current Phase**: Organization and modernization
- Legacy materials (2024) being updated for 2025-2026 technologies
- Integration of ContextForge with psychological subsystems in progress
- Preparing for brainstorming phase

## Key Concepts

1. **ContextForge** - Manages limited context windows using PERMANENT/STABLE/WORKING zones
2. **62 Subsystems** - Modular psychological components (empathy, safety, curiosity, etc.)
3. **Memory Architecture** - 6 types of memory working together
4. **Safety-First Design** - Reality boundaries, crisis detection, dependency prevention
