# Galatea Guiding Principles

**Established**: 2026-02-01
**Status**: Active - All decisions must align with these principles

---

## 1. Pragmatical Approach
**"Practice is the criterion of truth"**

- Every decision must serve a **concrete, practical goal**
- We evaluate ideas by asking: "Does this solve a real problem?"
- Theoretical elegance is irrelevant if it doesn't work in practice
- If we can't articulate the practical benefit, we don't build it
- **Test**: Can we describe what this enables us to DO?

---

## 2. Iterative Approach
**"Useful at every step"**

- Each increment must be **independently useful**
- No multi-month journeys to a first useful result
- Ship working software frequently (days/weeks, not months)
- Each iteration builds on the last, but stands alone
- No "it'll be useful once we finish everything"
- **Test**: Could we stop here and have something valuable?

---

## 3. Reuse
**"Team of one leverages the work of thousands"**

- Always prefer existing solutions over building from scratch
- Use established frameworks, libraries, and services
- Integrate, don't reinvent
- Only build what's uniquely necessary for our specific goals
- Labor-intensive work (infrastructure, UI, tools) must be reused
- **Test**: Does this already exist in a reusable form?

## Application

These principles apply to:
- Architecture decisions
- Technology choices
- Feature prioritization
- Implementation approach
- Evaluation of progress

When in doubt, return to these principles.
